# SearchEngine in Java

It is a text file search engine. It reads all the files in a runtime user specified directory.
While reading it ignores the stop words. If you dont know about stop words google it.
If the word is not a stop word then the word is stored in AVL Tree. Repeated words also ignore.
When user enters a keword to search it iterates through the AVL Tree and thus reduecd the searching time.
So it works very Fast.
It Just a simple implementation of how in real Search Engine Works :)
